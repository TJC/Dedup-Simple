Currently the system never removes deleted files from the checksum database.

I guess I need another pass which does something like:

 for each file in database:
    delete record from db unless file exists

but it's annoying to have to do that when I've just finished running something
that already check every file existing file, in the build_db.pl phase.

Maybe that phase should update a run-id on each file in the db, then at the
end of that phase it can do DELETE FROM files WHERE run < $current_run;
